Java SE 6 Student Guide and Java para No Programadores code

No Alphabet employee or familiar of Alphabet employee, or familiar of a Bank owner, this is, son, nephew, or related, etc. can use this code without the permission of me Enrique Martínez Ríos, you can email me (if you smart enough you know already my email or tell me directly by any way you want to contact me), if you do without my permission, you will live in shame for the rest of your life and live in my list of banned for life and you will remember always that you owe me 1 million dollars for the rest of your life for just skipping a simple question "Can I use your code to learn Java?".

Be sure that always are people looking at you who downloads things in internet, even if you use VPN or any NSA software to avoid tracking and identification in internet, so someone will tell me and I'll have your name in my list of banned and people who owe me forever.
